# Er det fredag?

This is a simple school project that tells you if today is Friday.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file for the project.
- `js/script.js`: This JavaScript file contains the logic to determine if today is Friday.

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Functionality

The `friday()` function in `js/script.js` checks if today is Friday. If it is, it displays "Ja!" in green and triggers a confetti animation. If it's not Friday, it displays "Nej!" in red.
